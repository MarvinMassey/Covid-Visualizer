# CS 416 Narrative Visualization: COVID-19 Visualizer
This project, the COVID-19 Visualizer, was developed in CS 416 for Narrative Visualization final project. The goal of this visualization is to explore and understand the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic when it first started in 2020, in six of the most populous US states. The project takes inspiration from the website https://alicesf2.github.io/covid-viz/index.html but implements its own unique approach to visualizing the data.

The narrative visualization uses an interactive slideshow, where user exploration is allowed at some or all of the steps of the story (which is one of the three effective narrative visualization structures). This approach allows users to embark on a guided journey through the data while having the freedom to explore and interact with the visualizations at their own pace. The narrative-driven structure provides context and insight, making the exploration of COVID-19 spread in the US states an engaging and informative experience.

The narrative visualization is built with scenes, annotations, parameters, and triggers.

## Messaging

The message communicated with the COVID-19 Visualizer is the impact of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic in six specific US states. I want to highlight the variations in the spread and response to the virus through the quarantine and provide valuable insights into the consequences of the pandemic on public health.

## Narrative Structure

The narrative visualization follows an interactive slideshow structure. Users are guided through a pre-defined sequence of scenes that tell a cohesive story about the COVID-19 spread in California, Texas, Florida, New York, Pennsylvania, and Illinois. However, the structure allows users the freedom to explore and interact with the visualizations at various points during the narrative, offering a personalized and engaging experience. The "drill-down" and exploration opportunities happen in the form of interactive visualizations and controls provided at specific steps in the slideshow.

## Visual Structure

Each scene in the interactive slideshow has a clear visual structure to enhance understanding and navigation:

1. **Data Representation**: Charts are used in each scene to present the number of cases over time in each state.

2. **Data Highlighting**: The visual structure ensures that important data points, trends, and patterns are highlighted using annotations to direct the viewer's attention to critical information.

3. **Consistent Navigation**: The visual layout and placement of navigation controls are consistent throughout the slideshow, making it easy for the viewer to transition between scenes and access interactive elements.

## Scenes

The narrative visualization is divided into the following scenes:

1. COVID-19 in the 6 most populous states in the USA: Provides an overview of the visualization's purpose and the states selected for analysis.

2. California: Presents a time graph that illustrates the number of COVID-19 cases over time in the year 2020. This scene includes the first reported case in California, provides information about the state's population, and has annotations indicating key dates.

3. Texas: Presents a time graph that illustrates the number of COVID-19 cases over time in the year 2020. This scene includes the first reported case in Texas, provides information about the state's population, and has annotations indicating key dates.

4. Florida: Presents a time graph that illustrates the number of COVID-19 cases over time in the year 2020. This scene includes the first reported case in Florida, provides information about the state's population, and has annotations indicating key dates.

5. New York: Presents a time graph that illustrates the number of COVID-19 cases over time in the year 2020. This scene includes the first reported case in New York, provides information about the state's population, and has annotations indicating key dates.
   
7. Pennsylvania: Presents a time graph that illustrates the number of COVID-19 cases over time in the year 2020. This scene includes the first reported case in Pennsylvania, provides information about the state's population, and has annotations indicating key dates.
   
9. Illinois: Presents a time graph that illustrates the number of COVID-19 cases over time in the year 2020. This scene includes the first reported case in Illinois, provides information about the state's population, and has annotations indicating key dates.

10. Conclusion: Summarizes the findings and key takeaways from the visualization.

## Annotations

The narrative visualization follows a template of informative and concise annotations placed alongside the data representations. The annotations serve to:

- Provide context and explanations for the data displayed in each scene.

- Support the messaging by guiding the viewer's interpretation of the visualizations.

- Change within a single scene to update the viewer on data changes or new developments.

## Parameters

The parameters of the narrative visualization include:

1. **States Selection**: Users can select three specific US states for analysis at the beginning of the visualization.

2. **Time Range**: Users have the option to adjust the time range to focus on specific periods of interest.

## Triggers

Triggers in the narrative visualization connect user actions to changes of state. These include:

1. **Scene Navigation**: Users can progress through the interactive slideshow using navigation controls or skip ahead to specific scenes.

2. **Interactive Visualizations**: Users can interact with the visualizations to explore data within each scene.

Affordances provided to the user include:

1. **Clear Navigation Controls**: Easily identifiable navigation buttons to move forward and backward through the slideshow.

2. **Interactive Elements**: Visual cues, such as hover effects and clickable elements, indicate interactive parts of the visualizations.

3. **Instructions**: Clear instructions and prompts within the visualization guide users on how to interact and explore.
